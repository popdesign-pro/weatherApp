- It's structured by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- It's to make sure how you feel about the current weather.

- App strategy:
  1. Node environment with Express and the necessary project dependencies.
  2. set up a server with GET and POST routes.
  3. create developer credentials for a Web API.
  4. use the Fetch API with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes.
  5. I access a GET route on the server side, from a function called on the client side.
  6. access HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamically.
